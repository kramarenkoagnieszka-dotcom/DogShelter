# Dog Shelter Management System

A Java-based console application designed to manage animal shelter operations, including dog profiles, adoptions, and financial tracking.

## 🎯 Project Goals & Learning Objectives
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in **Java Core** and clean code practices through a real-world business logic scenario.

**Key areas covered:**
* **Advanced Logic & Algorithms**: Implementing a matching engine to connect adopters with suitable dogs based on complex criteria.
* **Data Persistence**: Handling I/O operations to save and load system state from physical files (Data Storage).
* **Exception Handling**: Building a robust system that gracefully handles invalid user input and file errors.
* **Collection Framework**: Efficient use of `List`, `Map`, and `Set` to manage shelter resources and user databases.
* **Software Architecture**: Organizing code into logical packages to maintain high readability and scalability.
* **OOP Principles**: Practical application of Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction to model shelter hierarchy.

## 🚀 Features (In Development)
* **User Management**: Different roles (Admin, Staff, Adopter, Donor) with specific permissions.
* **Dog Profiles**: Comprehensive dog data including energy levels, needs, and medical expenses.
* **Adoption System**: Matching engine to find the best dog for a potential adopter.
* **Financial Module**: Shelter vault management to track donations and animal-related costs.
* **Data Persistence**: Saving and loading data from text files.
